# Pong C Threads
Classic game of Pong in the terminal made in C and implemented with threads.

# How to build
Simply run:
```shell
make
```

# How to run
On UNIX-like operating systems use;
```shell

```

It can also be placed within your `$PATH` and run with simply `pong` from any folder.

Have not tried this on Windows, yet.

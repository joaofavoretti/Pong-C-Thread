# How to build

If you do not have ncurses installed, use:
```shell
(UBUNTU) sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
```

Then, simply run:
```shell
make
```

# How to run
On UNIX-like operating systems use;
```shell
./pong
```

It can also be placed within your `$PATH` and run with simply `pong` from any folder.

Have not tried this on Windows, yet.
